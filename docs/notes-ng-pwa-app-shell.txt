The Angular App Shell
---------------------
- In order to measure the performance of the app, we can use Performance tab within developer console.

- Before measuring performance, clear/unregister the service worker. This can be done by using 'Unregister' option within 'Service Workers' option of 'Application' tab 
  - Open Developer Tools within Chrome
  - Go to Application tab
  - Select Service Workers option
  - Click Unregister option
  
- Start profiling the app
  - Go to Performance tab within Developer Tools
  - Start profiling the app
  - As soon as the page show some content, stop profiling
  
- Copy content of index.html into a temp html. Observe that it is a blank page. There is no significant content in it. 
  - We are waiting for Angular to bootstrap itself
  - Fetch data from the network and display the list
  - Start rendering the skeleton of the page 

- How can we improve the time to first render? The only way to improve is to serve more html in the initial request.
  - We may have to add a complete menu
  - We may have to add a loading indicator
  - This is just to give some visual feedback to the user

- The goal is to add more HTML to our initial index.html that gets served to the client's browser
  - In order to do this we need to pre-render some of our main page content
  - We need Angular Universal to do pre-rendering
  
  - We need to add Angular universal support to our app
  - Go to command prompt
  - Execute this command
    ng generate universal ngu-app-shell

  - This app is going to be used only at build time when we issue command
    ng build --prod
    
  - Is used to pre-render some of our content and add the result directly to index.html which will contain more content
  
  - package.json
    - new entry added - "@angular/platform-server": "^5.1.2"
    
  - run 'npm i' to install angular platform server dependency
  
  - angular-cli.json
    - new entry added in "apps" array
    
    - note that there will not be any angular universal server present at runtime. This app will only be used at build time to pre-render a given route. The pre-rendered html and css content will be copied directly to our index.html
    
  - The ngu-app-shell angular universal app is a build time auxilliary concept that is used to pre-render some html content that will be added to index.html
  
  - Following new files are created:
    - tsconfig.server.json
    - main.server.ts
    - app.server.module.ts
    
- Adding app shell to the app
  - ng generate app-shell my-shell --universal-app=ngu-app-shell --route=app-shell-path
  
  - angular-cli.json
      "appShell": {
        "app": "ngu-app-shell",
        "route": "app-shell-path"
      }

  - app.server.module.ts
  
    const routes: Routes = [ { path: 'app-shell-path', component: AppShellComponent }];
    @NgModule({
      imports: [
        AppModule,
        ServerModule,
        RouterModule.forRoot(routes),
      ],
      bootstrap: [AppComponent],
      declarations: [AppShellComponent],
    })
    export class AppServerModule {}

  - app-shell.component.ts
    - delete html template file
    - delete css file

    @Component({
      selector: 'app-app-shell',
      template: `<img class="loading-indicator" src="/assets/loading.gir">`,
      styles: [
        `
        .loading-indicator {
          height: 300px;
          margin: 0 auto;
        }
      `
      ]
    })
    export class AppShellComponent implements OnInit {
      constructor() {}

      ngOnInit() {}
    }
